when switching vessels using the arrow in the GUI, camera does not reset to vessel camera... eeps space center camera?
parse coord values to 5 or 6 digits after decimal?... to 1m accuracy? at least in the GUI display?

widen GUI window, so coord boxes show full parsed value?

when three or moar vessels, first one gets deactivated (stops moving)

north one: 0.0484, -74.4831 (pos 0.0139, 74.6989, hdg: 359)
west one: -0.2161, -75.0037
Set target: boxes coords switch to target coords of last controller activated, top Target lat/Target long: remain normal
craft seems to not move, after revisiting it, then leaving to Space Center scene?

craft seems rotated 90° to heading when you switch to it? even with disable rotation set in settings
do braes automatically engage when switching to active bonvoyage vessel?
