// <-- These dbl-frwd slashes are comment markers.

// They may be added anywhere in the file. To un-comment text, just remove the slashes. 
// All comments may also be deleted from the file, without affecting function


PART // *DO NOT CHANGE* <-- "PART" designates/applies the following sections, between the PART node's brackets, as a "part" in game 
{

	module = Part
	author = Colin Votier, Stone Blue // <-- feel free to add your name

	MODEL
	{
		model = OCD/Assets/Chip/OCD_Chip // *DO NOT CHANGE* <-- folder path where the Chip.mu is located
	}
	rescaleFactor = 1.0  // *DO NOT CHANGE* <-- rescales the part. Defaults to 1.25, if not specifically defined (inc. the model AND the attachment nodes)

	attachRules = 1,0,0,0,1  // <-- *DO NOT CHANGE* defines how a part attaches to other parts. stack, surface attach, allow stack, allow surface, allow collision
	node_stack_top = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0  // <-- *DO NOT CHANGE*  defines the location of the attach nodes; location x,y,z, orientation x,y,z, and node size (the green circle that shows in game) 

	title = OCD Circuit Board Accelerometer  // <-- feel free to come up with your own part name (this is the name of the part that shows up in-game)
	manufacturer = OCD Industries  // <-- feel free to come up with your own manufacturer name
	description = Using the basic hardware in the computer core, this chip will allow measurements of the acceleration of your craft and all that movement-based sciency stuff.
	
	TechRequired = electronics  // <-- change this to the catagory where you want the part to appear in the TechTree
	entryCost = 8200  // <-- change to whatever you want
	cost = 6000  // <-- change to whatever you want
	category = Science  // <-- change this to the category you want the part to be under in the VAB/SPH part menu
	subcategory = 0 // <-- ???? vOv
	mass = 0.002 // <-- can be changed, but I suggest not. Stock minimum to work with inventories is 0.002 (4.4lbs) so they are already pretty heavy.
